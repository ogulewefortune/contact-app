# contact-app
Contact app built with Scene Builder and Eclipse IDE
A contact app built with Scene Builder and Eclipse is a software application designed to manage and organize contacts. The app includes a search function to find specific contacts, a clear function to remove all contacts, and a save function to store contacts.
The app would store contact information such as name, phone number, email address, and any other relevant details. Users would be able to add, edit, and delete contacts as needed. The search function would allow users to quickly find specific contacts, and the clear function would remove all contacts from the app. Finally, the save function would ensure that the user's contact list is preserved for future use.
